# E-COMMERCE WEBSITE
E-commerce has changed the way people shop products and services. Inspired from the e-commerce websites which we use in 
our daily lives, I have created my own fully-functional e-commerce shopping website using combination of technologies that I have learnt. 
The front-end of the website was built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
along with React Router for managing routing and navigation within the app. I also used Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS 
framework, to style the website and make it look more professional. For the database, I used Dexie.js, a powerful in-browser database.
Also, the graphic design for the entire website was initially done in Figma.

One of the most complex aspects of this project was implementing the user authentication and authorization system.
This involved creating routes and components for signing up, logging in, and managing user accounts. I also had to
securely store user passwords and implement password hashing to protect user data. Additionally, I had to create a
system for managing user orders and displaying order history along with adding responsive design to the website. 
Overall, this project was a challenging and rewarding experience that allowed me to learn and apply a wide range of 
technologies to create a functional e-commerce shopping website.
